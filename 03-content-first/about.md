I moved to the Czech Republic almost 5 years ago. While studying landscape design and urbanism at university, I realized that it was not my thing, that I wanted to connect my life with art, that I wanted to create. Shortly before enrolling, I bought my first analog camera. And that was it! I realized that photography is my passion, the Covid of course really hindered this, but I still found opportunities! 
I take my photographs on film cameras and on digital cameras.  But film is in my heart. Developing, scanning, enlarging photos by hand gives me an incredible sense of satisfaction and belonging to what I do. 

Traveling is my passion too, for me it's really connected to photography. When I am traveling, when I am in new city I really want to make photos of everything, not just to remember my trip or whatever, but because everything is different, new buildings, people, nature and it gives me powers to live and create. 

Also I used to play bass guitar in a band, and in covid I bought an electric guitar that just stands there all this time :)) 
By the way! I work in a craft taproom in Prague. Craft beer is a huge world, I think everyone should try these divine drinks.
