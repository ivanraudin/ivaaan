War. 

We hear this word a lot, world situation, history classes, news, “kitchen” talks, as an expression, when you have misunderstandings with neighbors etc. 
For all Ukrainians almost 2 years ago this “word” became a reality. May be even for whole world. It is the most terrifying thing that can happen. Luckily for me, I was  in Prague when war started. Luckily for me, I canceled my flight to Kyiv on 14.02.2022, 10 days before war started. Luckily, my family is still alive and now kinda okay. I didn't seen my father for 2 years, because it's forbidden for man's to live the country. I wish it never happened, this word, this rusians, bring only suffer and sadness not only for Ukrainians, but for a lot of people around the world. I don't really want to write or to talk about war, it's hard. Even though 2 years have passed, it's still sad. People are still dying for no reason. But it is the only word I can use for this essay, there are no other words that can make me cry or feel sad that fast. 
I don't want to end on this sad note. Words are just words. It's quiet in Kyiv right now, not always, but better than it was. My father got an opportunity to leave the country for a few weeks, so maybe I will see him soon.
